Create 3D interactive objects
# Final Project: 3D Scene Development

## Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of a 3D scene with low-polygon models, textures, lighting, and interactive camera navigation. The work was completed through iterative milestones, each adding a specific aspect of the final scene.

## Design Approach

### Software Design Philosophy
The design process began with a thorough understanding of project requirements, focusing on breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable components. The project emphasized simplicity, low-polygon modeling, and structured, modular design to optimize performance.

### New Design Skills Acquired
Working on this project improved my ability to:
- Design low-polygon 3D models with organized geometry.
- Balance visual quality with performance by limiting polygon counts.
- Modularize functionality for easier adjustments and reusability.

### Design Process Followed
The design process included:
1. Conceptualization: Identifying required shapes and textures.
2. Implementation: Building basic 3D models and adding navigation controls.
3. Refinement: Iteratively enhancing textures, lighting, and interactivity based on feedback.

### Tactics for Future Work
The tactics used in this project, such as breaking tasks into components, focusing on modular design, and iterative refinement, will be valuable for future software projects, ensuring clarity and maintainability.

## Development Approach

### Program Development Strategy
The development process started with a simple prototype, followed by iterative feature additions. Each milestone focused on achieving a specific objective, such as adding objects, implementing camera controls, or refining textures and lighting.

### New Development Strategies Employed
- **Phong Shading**: For realistic lighting effects.
- **Modular Functions**: To organize camera controls, lighting, and object placement effectively.
- **Interactive Controls**: WASD/QE keys for movement, mouse for orientation, and mouse scroll for speed adjustments.

### Role of Iteration
Iteration was essential, with each milestone providing feedback that guided the refinement of models, textures, and interactivity, leading to a polished final product.

### Evolution of Code Development
The approach evolved by incorporating feedback, learning from each milestone, and refining code for better efficiency. Emphasis was placed on adhering to best practices in code formatting, commenting, and logic.
